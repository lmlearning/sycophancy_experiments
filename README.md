##  Overview

The software project is an open-source repository designed to enhance conversational AI models, particularly those built on the Llama2 architecture. Its core functionalities encompass model inference, training, and evaluation, allowing users to generate contextual responses and fine-tune language models using pre-trained datasets, such as the facty and happy datasets. The `dpo_inference.py` file serves as a facilitator for user-defined model interactions, streamlining the process of generating outputs while integrating model loading and prompt formatting. Meanwhile, `dpo_trainer.py` acts as a central hub for integrating and refining empathetic and accurate dialogue responses across various conversational intents. Complementing these components, the evaluation script (eval_7b.sh) systematically assesses model performance, producing results in JSON format for comprehensive analysis. This structured and well-organized approach not only enriches user interactions but also promotes the development of nuanced AI dialogue systems, delivering significant value to developers and researchers in the field of conversational AI.
